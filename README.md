# Software Developer Portfolio - Stephane Emptage

## Introduction

I am a budding software developer. I am close to finishing an Apprenticeship in Software Development Level 4 (end date April 2021). The first language I learnt on my Apprenticeship was JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I am also learning C++ in my free time. You can see some of my projects below and a description about what they do.


## My Projects

## Web Development Project (C#, JS, TypeScript, CSS, HTML)

### ReactSite - **[Code](https://github.com/StefEmp/ReactSite)**
ReactSite is a projected created by Stephane Emptage and Alex Paiu whilst training in their apprenticeship. It is a proof of concept to show the business a prototype of what a React based recruitment site would look like and how it would work, when the business eventually transitions to using React. Langauges used: C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Semantic UI.

## C++ focused projects

### Overview

To translate my knowledge of object oriented programming from JavaScript to C++ and the Unreal Engine I am following **[this](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/)** course on udemy, as well as **[this](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/)**  course to learn more about pure C++.
I will over time be adding video links to showcase my understanding and also to hopefully make it easier for potential employers to see my projects without necessarily having to look through all my code (unless they want to!).

### Escape The Building - **[Code](https://github.com/StefEmp/EscapeTheBuilding)** - **[Video](https://youtu.be/teJxwSS8iN4)**
#### Overview
This game is about escaping a building. I developed the gameplay mechanics on a test level. I created a basic room with a door and the player can place two objects on a trigger volume to open the door and escape. The mechanics I coded into the game were: door physics, linking a trigger volume to my door object and adding mass and gravity to the player pawn and objects. 

Following this I created a bigger level with some assets from the Unreal store. The player has to find two statues and put them on two different pedestals to open the double doors and escape the dungeon.

This has been a fun project, where I have been learning about pointers, FVectors and implementing game designer friendly parameters using UPROPERTY. It was also a good challenge to start making and thinking about level design.

### Bull Cow Game - **[Code](https://github.com/StefEmp/BullCowGame)** - **[Video](https://youtu.be/ObVzNoW1jsE)**
#### Overview
Bull Cow Game is set in a 3D world. You have a sign post which you can type into. 
The basic idea is that you need to guess the word. The word will be an "Isogram" an Isogram is a word that does not have repeating letters. 
The game is created using the Unreal Engine and C++, the functionality of the terminal has been coded using C++ while the 3D aspects are done using the Unreal engine, such as asset placement, lighting, terrain and map generation. The main purpose of this project was to learn C++ and implement things such as loops, functions, arrays and other useful forms of object oreintated langauge.

### Netrunner - **[Code](https://github.com/StefEmp/Netrunner)** - **[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcMQp_VILNs&feature=youtu.be)**
#### Overview
Netrunner is a basic game coded in C++. You are a hacker, you need to figure out the correct codes to progress. There are 5 levels to complete. The game is played in your terminal. I used this project to transfer my understanding of object oreintated programming from other languages to C++.
